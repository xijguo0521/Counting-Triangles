Final project for Data Mining course in which I implemented and evaluated two data stream algorithms for triangle counting, TRIÈST-BASE and TRIÈST-IMPR. The implementation was based on the paper titled ["TRIÈST: Counting Local and Global Triangles in Fully Dynamic Streams with Fixed Memory Size"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3059194).
